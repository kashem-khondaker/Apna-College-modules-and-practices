        <h1>Ozymandias</h1>

            <p>
                I met a traveller from an antique land, <br>
                Who said -"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  <br>
                Stand in the desert . . . . Near then , on the sand , <br>
                Half sunk a shattered visage lies , whose frown , <br>
                And wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command , <br>
                Tell that its scuolptor well those passsions read <br>
                Which yet survive, stamped these lifeless things , <br>
                The hand that mocked then, and the heart that fed; <br>And on the prdestal, these words appear : <br>
                My name is Owymandia , King of Kings; <br>
                Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! <br>
                Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br>
                Of that colossal Wreck, Bouondless and bare <br>
                Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <br>
                The lone and level sands stretch far away. "
            </p>
